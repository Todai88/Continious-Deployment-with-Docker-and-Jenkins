# Continious Deployment with Docker and Jenkins
### A book by **[Packt publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/continuous-delivery-docker-and-jenkins)**

This repository functions as a way for me to store my progress through the book with the repository name. 

Differences to the book:
* AWS (Ec2) instance to host my Docker containers. 
* Alpine containers instead of Ubuntu, to lessen the harddrive requirements and increase speed.
* GoLang instead of Java, so all of the book's Java code has been translated to GoLang.
